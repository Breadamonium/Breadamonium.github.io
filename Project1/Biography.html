			<hr />Hi there! Welcome to my website!
				My name is Youliang Pan, but I really prefer to be called Vincent.
				I am currently a sophomore at Cornell&#8217;s College of Engineering studying Computer Science. I was born in Hangzhou, China in 1995. However, I immigrated to America when I was three years old. For a while, I was in ESOL classes at school, but was able to pick up English well enough to get out of them by the second grade. When I was six I started playing the piano, although I quit after I was ten; instead, I started playing in the school band on trumpet. In middle school, I took up swimming as a sport, and also changed instruments again to the Euphonium as our band was lacking members in the low brass section. After graduating from middle school, I went on to attend River Hill High School, where it seems like I finally had some stability in my life as I stayed with the same sport and musical instrument. 

				As a high school senior, I applied early decision to Cornell University and was accepted. It was also senior year when I took a second computer science class which interested me enough to decide my major as Computer Science at Cornell. Now at Cornell, I have learned Python, Java, OCAML, C++, HTML, CSS, and Unix scripting.  Please check out the other links above for more information about me!
