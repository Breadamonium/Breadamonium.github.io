								<h2> Sparkstone Analytics Website</h2>
								<h3><i>December 2016</i></h3>
								<h4>
								This project was done for my friend's club they recently founded here at Cornell. Their club is based on using computer
								analytic programs for informed quantitative trading. Combining interests in both computer programming and finance, my friends
								just released open applications to the club this past month during Cornell's club fair. Here, I did most of the work with the 
								design on the front-end, and they provided me with the content to fill the site. Although the site is not very technically complex
								with few server-side queries, it showcases my front-end development skills in responsive design and aethestics.

								<h2> Uber Reminder Rides | iOS App</h2>
								<h3><i>September 2015</i></h3>
								<h4>
								This project was done in 48-hours during Cornell's Big Red Hacks 2015. It was an app that integrated 
								the iOS native calendar app with Uber's API. "Events" could be scheduled for the future and an uber-ride
								request attached to that event. Then on that day, the app would automatically schedule the uber for the 
								person.

								<h2> Afya Volunteering Sign-in | Web App</h2>
								<h3><i>November 2015</i></h3>
								<h4>
								This project was done in 48-hours during Cornell's Random hacks of kindness event. Atypical of a usual hackathon, 
								participants instead were grouped with business majors and other discliplines to specifically work on projects 
								brought in from non-profit companies in the local area. This web application was to design something to solve
								Afya's volunteering tracking and system sign-in problem. Currently they worked with Excel and Survey monkey to 
								keep track of volunteers, so it was unreliable and costly. We built a web-app with a database back-end to easily 
								keep track of volunteer hours and sign-ins/sign-outs. Additionally, we also had an admin panel which features 
								simplified analytics of all the data in the database.

								<h2> CS 3300 | D3 Dynamic Data Visualization</h2>
								<h3><i>April 2016</i></h3>
								<h4>
								We created dynamic visualizations using d3 scalable vector graphics.
								We collected data for this project, in the form of election data and greenhouse gas emissions data for states over many years. Our site uses
								d3 to parse through our data CSV files which then dynamically generate graphs and choropleths based on user interaction on the site.

								<h2> CS 4320 | BCNF Tree</h2>
								<h3><i>October 2015</i></h3>
								<h4>
								For this project, we implemented a B+ tree in java. Given a generic framework of a linkedlist of nodes, we had to properly 
								implement insertion and deletion of records. Additionally, we had to follow the post condition in which we must split full buckets after an insertion, and then redistribute records to the left or right tree depending on the load. For deletion, we had to check if the bucket was underfull, and then combine buckets and redistribute if neccessary. Finally we had to reset the root of the tree if a split or a combine of buckets caused the tree level to increase or decrease. In this project, I learned about indexing and tree traversal for B+ trees.

								<h2> CS 3410 | Network Honeypot</h2>
								<h3><i>April 2015</i></h3>
								<h4>
								We wrote a device driver in C for a simulated network card. We would be 
								given packets of data in the form of bits. We had to process these bits to 
								analyze the bits and classify them as spammer, normal, or evil. We were given 
								8 rings to act as 8 simulated threads running the same program concurrently, 
								but with all 8 rings drawing from the same queue of packets. In this project, I learned
								about multi-threading and bit analysis.

								<h2> CS 3410 | MIPS-complaint CPU</h2>
								<h3><i>February 2015</i></h3>
								<h4>
								We created a fully-working CPU that could handle MIPs instructions in Logicism. 
								This built on a previous project in the class in which we coded up an ALU. Though this project did not involve coding, it was still a learning experience in which us computer science majors were introduced to the world of ECE and how computers work on the architectural level.

								<h2> CS 3110 | Pokemon Game</h2>
								<h3><i>December 2014 </i></h3>
								<h4>
								In this project, we created the framework for the Pokemon-imitation game 
								in OCAML. We had to work out the drafting of pokemon by two players along with the
								simulated battle with those pokemon afterwards. Items and pokemon moves were given 
								as input files, but we had to code the actual effects those things did to the stats of the pokemon objects. Finally, we also created a rudimentary AI bot that drafted pokemon
								and played out the battle against other students' AI bots in the class. In this project, I learned about the importance of git in a large, complex software project along with working with other students.

								<h2> CS 2110 | Danaus Butterfly Flowers</h2>
								<h3><i>April 2014 </i></h3>
								<h4>
								In this project, I learned to implement complex traversal algorithms such as DFS and BFS. In the project, I had to make a butterfly traverse through a map of flowers and collect each once, along with minimizing the path it goes through. In this project, I learned about the importance of program runtime and how to implement algorith pseudocode in java.

								<h2> CS 1110 | Breakout Game</h2>
								<h3><i>December 2013</i></h3>
								<h4>
								In this project, I created an imitation of the classic arcade game Breakout in python.
								Here we were given a library of classes including the ball, the bricks, the pad, along with given mouse-click and movement classes. I had to code up the physics of the ball movement after bouncing off the pad along with the actual mouse clicking and tracking to move the pad. Finally, the program had to check for when the player won or if he/she lost when time was up. In this project, I learned to read basic documentation of pre-written code/libraries and how to integrate other people's code with mine.
